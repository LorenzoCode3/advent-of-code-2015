# Advent of Code 2015 - Python Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code 2015 challenges, written in Python. The code is organized day by day in separate folders.

## Repository Structure

The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
advent-of-code-2015/
│
├── Day1/
│   ├── Day1Part1.py
│   ├── Day1Part2.py
│   └── input.txt
│
├── Day2/
│   ├── Day2Part1.py
│   ├── Day2Part2.py
│   └── input.txt
│
└── Day25/
    ├── Day25Part1.py
    ├── Day25Part2.py
    └── input.txt
```

Each `DayXX` folder contains:
- `DayXXPart1.py`: The Python script to solve part 1 of the day's challenge.
- `DayXXPart2.py`: The Python script to solve part 2 of the day's challenge.
- `input.txt`: The input file used to test the solutions.

## How to Run the Solutions
